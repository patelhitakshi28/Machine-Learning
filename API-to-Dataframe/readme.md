# Fetching data using API. 

1. Here in this i have used TMDB movie's API to fetch the movie data. 
2. After understanding the fetched data i have extracted only required columns out of it. 
3. After fetching the required columns i have stored the data in CSV file format. 
4. You can also find this data on Kaggle.
